    "\n",
    "Perishable foods such as fruits and vegetables have a limited self-life after harvest or production. Most of these crops must be traded with in 1-2 weeks of harvesting. Through this capstone project I am planning to design an algorithm which can suggest a particular state in India about what are the best set of states to trade a particular crop. If a particular crop is expected to get exported the algorithm should suggest the states to trade with for high profit margins or else in case of importing a perishable food crop the suggestions should be made to minimize the import price of the crop.\n",

    "India is an agricultural country and one third population depends on the agricultural sector directly or indirectly. Agriculture remains as the main stray of almost all Indian states economy. The primary income for large sector of people in each state in India is agriculture and most of the state produces same set of different variety of crops. Indian agriculture mostly depends on rainfall and other climatic conditions. India is a peninsula as it is surrounded by 3 different water bodies on three sides each state will be experiencing different climatic conditions which in turn effects the crop production. I am choosing perishable crops (Mostly fruits and vegetables) because unlike cash crops perishable crops should be transported and use within 1-2 weeks of harvesting. As seasonal weather forecast for is more reliable, I want to build a model such that both government and farmers can plan efficiently to reach their desirable margins. Using this recommendation system government can plan imports and exports across the country to increase farm profitability. Trade plays a crucial role in providing livelihoods for farmers and people employed along the food supply chain. A well-planned trade model in case of exports will bring good revenue for sate government and farm price for their crop. The government can estimate the import prices of perishable crops and can try to minimize the price as much as they can.\n",
